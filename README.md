InterviewPrep is an intelligent, voice-powered interview assistant that helps users practice and improve their interview performance in a natural, conversational way. Built with Next.js on the frontend and Firebase as the backend, it ensures smooth authentication and secure data handling using JWT tokens. The platformâ€™s core experience runs on Vapi workflows, enabling realistic voice-based interview sessions that feel interactive and dynamic. After each session, users can view a personalized feedback page and a result summary with insights to help them grow. The project blends AI, voice technology, and thoughtful design to make interview preparation more engaging, accessible, and effective.
